# Polynomial Playground (making PTG work)

From Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.

Before beginning the final project, this is a chance to play around with cost function design and weight tweaking. In the Python code provided, you have a working Polynomial Trajectory Generator. You can see it in action by doing the following:

## Getting Started
- Project code provided via  **TrajectoryExercise2**.
- From the project's directory, run `python evaluate_ptg.py`. You should see a plot similar to the one below. This plot shows the s (x-axis) and d(y-axis) trajectories followed by a vehicle in traffic (red) and a self driving car (blue).
